We're particularly concerned about some states in the West, where Candy Corn favoritism* was highest as a percentage of states and altered the authorities there to be prepared. We've also warned authorities to be ready in Michigan and New Mexico, which ranked Candy Corn second overall.**"</span>
                        </blockquote>
                        <h6>* 38.5% of western states ranked candy corn as second or third, compared to 33% in the Midwest, 33% in the Northeast and 12.5% in the South.</h6>

                    <p>On November 1st, 2021, Americans awoke to disturbing news. Unbeknownst to many, Candy Corn is still popular candy. This revelation has sent shock waves through towns and cities across the United States; people had once believed the days of Candy Corn were behind them.</p>
                    <p>The statistics released by the Candy Metric and Analysis Company (CMAC) were particularly alarming in Nevada, North Dakota, and Utah. Nevada residents bought Candy Corn at a rate of 1 pound per every 20 residents. In North Dakota and Utah, the statistics are even worse. North Dakotans bought Candy Corn at a rate of 1 pound per every 15 residents and Utonians bought Candy Corn at a rate of 1 pound per every 13 residents. These states are classified as high consumption per capita and are under close watch by Federal and State authorities.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Linda Blessing, the director of the Center for Candy Control (CCC), reviewed the statistical data released this morning. She conveyed additional concern for the West, <span class="italics">"Not only was the state favoritism much higher in the West in general, but rate of Candy Corn purchased per capita in West makes us more concerned."</span> Analysis showed that people from western states purchased 1 pound of candy corn per every 24 residents. All other regions purchased candy corn at less than half that rate. The next highest region is the South which purchased candy corn at a rate 1 pound per every 59.4 residents.</p>
