However, a shocking 14 states Candy Corn ranked as a second or third favorite. We're particularly concerned about some states in the West, where Candy Corn favoritism* was highest as a percentage of states. We alerted authorities in these states to be prepared. We've also warned authorities to be ready in Michigan and New Mexico. Although these states do not a high purchase rate per capita, they ranked Candy Corn in second place overall, across all other candies.**"</span>

                    <p>On November 1st, 2021, Americans awoke to disturbing news. Unbeknownst to many, Candy Corn is still popular candy. This revelation has sent shock waves through towns and cities across the United States; people had once believed the days of Candy Corn were behind them.</p>
                    <p>The statistics released by the Candy Metric and Analysis Company (CMAC) were particularly alarming in Nevada, North Dakota, and Utah. CMAC is responsible for collecting data on candy consumption and currently monitors purchasing of twenty-four different candy types.</p>
                    <p>CMAC's estimates showed that Nevada residents bought Candy Corn at a rate of 1 pound per every 20 residents. In North Dakota and Utah, the statistics are even worse. North Dakotans bought Candy Corn at a rate of 1 pound per every 15 residents and Utonians bought Candy Corn at a rate of 1 pound per every 13 residents. These states are classified as high consumption per capita and are under close watch by Federal and State authorities.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Linda Blessing, the director of the Center for Candy Control (CCC), reviewed the statistical data released this morning. She conveyed additional concern for the West, <span class="italics">"Not only was the state favoritism much higher in the West in general, but rate of Candy Corn purchased per capita in West makes us more concerned."</span> Analysis showed that people from western states purchased 1 pound of Candy Corn per every 24 residents. All other regions purchased Candy Corn at less than half that rate. The next highest region is the South which purchased candy corn at a rate 1 pound per every 59.4 residents. These statistics translate into 4.2 pounds purchased per every 100 people in the West compared to only 1.7 pounds purchased per every 100 people in the South.</p>

                    <p>The graphics support the analytical findings from CMAC. The first slide shows the total pounds of Candy Corn purchased by State. Michigan looks like it could be an outlier. However, once the rates are normalized by the number of people living in each state, Michigan's per capita rate is much smaller than other states such as North Dakota. The last slide shows a summary of Candy Corn purchases by region and then normalized by the number of people living in each region. This slide very clearly shows heavy purchasing per capita in the West, with much more 'normal' behavior across all other regions.</p>
